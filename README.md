# pyclock
A computer application that shows the time and helps you manage time, written in python

This is the first repository I have made on GitHub. Oversights and improper usage of the site, included.
I'm looking forward on making progress on this project and all future projects.

My vision for this clock application is influenced my personal and intimate struggles with time perception.
Too often have I found myself distracted by entertainment or work and snapped out of it to realise that the day is gone.
And while the discovery of the pomodoro technique and https://pomofocus.io/ have been my remedy, I'd like to give it my own spin.
In addition to the disclosed, I am using this mainly as a learning experience with python and programming languages.

APPLICATION-IN-PLANNING :)
